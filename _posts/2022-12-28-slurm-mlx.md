title: [Slurm 1]: Setup Slurm with two Ubuntu20.04 hosts
---

## Motivation

During the investigation of DPU offload, Slurm is used as workload management system to integrate
with offload daemons. The document give a short description on how to install Slum with two Ubuntu20.04 hosts,
and enable prolog/epilog to launch/destroy offload daemons.

## Installation

```shell
$ sudo apt install -y slurmctld slurmd
```

### Generate slurm.conf

Build a configuration file using your favorite web browser and the [Slurm Configuration Tool](https://slurm.schedmd.com/configurator.html).

**NOTE**: set `SlurmUser` to `root` will make setup/configuration easier.

```shell
cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/slurm-llnl/slurm.conf
<the output of slurm configurator>
EOF
```

### Start control plane

```shell
$ sudo systemctl start slurmctld
```

### Start compute node

```shell
$ sudo systemctl start slurmd
```

### Verification

```shell
$ sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
dev*         up   infinite      1   idle hpc-02
```

## Trouble Shooting

### Failed to start control plane because of `Invalid SelectTypeParameters`

When slurm control plane start and got the following errors, it's required to deploy Munge keys into every node.

```shell
[2022-12-28T14:24:37.900] select/cons_tres: select_p_node_init
[2022-12-28T14:24:37.900] fatal: Invalid SelectTypeParameters: NONE (0), You need at least CR_(CPU|CORE|SOCKET)*
```

Add the following configuration into `/etc/slurm-llnl/slurm.conf` in control plane node.

```shell
SelectTypeParameters=CR_CPU
```

### Failed to authenticate compute nodes

When slurm control plane start and got the following errors, it's required to deploy Munge keys into every node.

```shell
[2022-12-29T03:58:02.770] error: slurm_unpack_received_msg: MESSAGE_NODE_REGISTRATION_STATUS has authentication error: Invalid authentication credential
[2022-12-29T03:58:02.770] error: slurm_unpack_received_msg: Protocol authentication error
[2022-12-29T03:58:02.780] error: slurm_receive_msg [10.209.226.195:36432]: Unspecified error
```

The following command will re-generate Munge key, and leverage `scp` to copy it into every node in the cluster.

```shell
$ sudo create-munge-key # generate munge key
$ scp /etc/munge/munge.key <all nodes of cluster> # copy munge.key into every node of the cluster
```
